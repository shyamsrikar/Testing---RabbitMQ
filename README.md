# Testing - RabbitMQ
## What is RabbitMQ?

RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker â€” a software that helps applications, services, and systems communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages through a centralized system.

### ðŸ§  In Simple Terms:
RabbitMQ acts like a "post office" between your applications:

- One application (producer) sends a message to RabbitMQ.

- Another application (consumer) receives it from RabbitMQ.
